"""In-process periodic data-sync loop.

Started unconditionally from the FastAPI lifespan; it polls a fixed tick and re-reads `sync_interval_hours`
from the server settings each cycle (so an admin change takes effect within a tick; `<= 0` = paused). It fires
off a **persisted** last-run marker (`sync_last_run_at` in server_settings), so a redeploy doesn't reset the
interval — and a never-synced server syncs shortly after first boot. Each run does a full Plaid + Splitwise
sync. Failures are logged, never raised; the marker is recorded only on success, so a failed sync retries next
tick. Cancelled cleanly on shutdown.
