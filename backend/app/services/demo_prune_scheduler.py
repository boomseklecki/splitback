"""In-process demo-cleanup loop.

Started unconditionally from the FastAPI lifespan; it only does work when `DEMO_MODE` is on. Every hour it
prunes ephemeral `demo-*` guest users (and their seeded data) older than the retention window, bounding the
demo backend's growth against scripted abuse of the open `/auth/demo` faucet. Failures are logged, never
raised. Cancelled cleanly on shutdown.
