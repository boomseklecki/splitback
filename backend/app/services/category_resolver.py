"""Server-side category resolver — the backend analogue of iOS `CategoryMapping.resolve(...)`.

Resolves a transaction's (or expense's) canonical category through the same 5-rank precedence chain the app
uses, so server-side spend computation agrees with what the user sees on-device:

  transaction: override → owner map → built-in Plaid (≠ "Other") → refined → built-in "Other"/raw
  expense:     owner map → built-in Plaid → Splitwise taxonomy → raw

The resolver is built once per owner from their `category_maps` (see `for_owner`, added once the table
exists) and resolves many rows cheaply — `override`/`refined` are passed in per row (they live on the
transaction's override row, not the base transaction).
