"""Pairwise ("friends") balance computation — your net with each person, Splitwise-style.

For Splitwise-imported expenses we use Splitwise's own authoritative per-expense debts in
`Expense.repayments` (a list of `{from, to, amount}` keyed by Splitwise user IDs — `from` owes `to`). These
are exactly what the Splitwise app reports and already encode settle-ups as reverse-direction repayments, so
they net the pair toward zero automatically. We do NOT re-derive pairwise debts from the splits proportionally
— Splitwise doesn't assign multi-payer debts proportionally, so that disagrees with (and can sign-flip) the
real balances.

For expenses with no repayments (self-hosted groups, or solo single-split items), we fall back to a
proportional split: "X owes Y" = `X.owed_share * (Y.paid_share / total_paid)`, so the caller's net with P is
`(P.owed_share * my.paid_share - my.owed_share * P.paid_share) / total_paid`.

Positive net = P owes the caller. Pure (no DB) so it's unit-testable; the router supplies the expenses (with
`.splits` and `.repayments`) and the Splitwise-ID → identifier map.
