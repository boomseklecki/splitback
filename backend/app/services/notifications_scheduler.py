"""In-process fast notifications-only poll.

A lighter sibling of `sync_scheduler`: every tick it re-reads `notifications_poll_minutes` (server settings;
`<= 0` = off) and, when that interval has elapsed since the persisted `notifications_last_poll_at` marker,
pulls *only* each Splitwise token's recent notifications (and pushes new partner activity) — skipping the
expensive groups/users/expenses sync. This makes partner-activity pushes near-real-time instead of waiting for
the slow full-sync interval. Failures are logged, never raised; the marker is recorded only on success.
Cancelled cleanly on shutdown.
