"""Server-side ports of the deterministic, built-in category maps and spend-class sets.

Mirrors the iOS enums verbatim so the backend resolves a transaction's canonical category the same way the
app does:

- `PlaidCategory` (`ios/.../Logic/PlaidCategory.swift`) → `plaid_canonical`
- `SplitwiseCategory` (`ios/.../Logic/SplitwiseCategory.swift`) → `splitwise_canonical`
- `CanonicalCategory` spend-class sets (`ios/.../Logic/CategoryMapping.swift`) → the sets below

These are closed, static taxonomies (no AI/network). `tests/test_category_builtin.py` pins them against the
iOS values and asserts every canonical output is in `app.categories.CATEGORIES` — the front-line defense
against iOS/backend resolver divergence.
